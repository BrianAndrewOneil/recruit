					<p>
						The involvement of public school teachers and educator preparation faculty is critical to the success of the GACE program. Please help us maintain high-quality education in Georgia public schools. The Georgia Professional Standards Commission encourages your participation.
					</p>	
						
					<p>
						You are welcomed to get involved now! 
					</p>
					<p>
						The GACE program is aligned with state and national standards for educator preparation and is designed to help identify educator candidates who have demonstrated the level of knowledge required to perform satisfactorily in their fields of specialization. The tests measure a candidate's knowledge and skills in relation to an established standard rather than in relation to the performance of other candidates.

				These guidelines apply to individuals who attend the program's test development conferences/meetings. Additional reimbursement instructions will be made available before each conference/meeting. Completed forms should be submitted to Evaluation Systems as soon as possible after the conference to ensure reimbursement in four to six weeks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please send all correspondence regarding these policies to <a href="mailto:EvaluationSystemsCRG@pearson.com"> EvaluationSystemsCRG@pearson.com</a>.</p>

				<h3 class="fs-5">Substitute Teacher</h3>

				<p>
					During the school year (contract days), Evaluation Systems will reimburse a public school educator's school district for the cost of a substitute teacher. Substitute reimbursement forms with additional instructions are distributed at each meeting. Please note that payment will be sent directly to the committee member's designated school/district office.
				</p>
				
				<h3 class="fs-5">Lodging</h3>

				<p>
					Hotel accommodations are available for those residing 50 or more miles from the meeting location, for those who are unable to travel due to adverse weather conditions,
					or as otherwise approved by Evaluation Systems. Hotel accommodations will be directly billed to Evaluation Systems. Although committee members will not be charged for their rooms, they will need to leave a deposit or credit card number at check-in to cover incidental expenses.
				</p>
				
				<h3 class="fs-5">Travel</h3>
				<p>
					Evaluation Systems will reimburse personal automobile use at the federal mileage rate, roundtrip ground transportation, or airfare. Evaluation Systems requires prior approval for car rental and airfare expenses. Parking and toll expenses will also be reimbursed.
				</p>
				
				<h3 class="fs-5">Meals</h3>
				<p>
					Depending on the conference agenda, a continental breakfast and lunch may be provided on the day of the conference. For meals that are not provided as a part of the meeting, a per diem reimbursement of $25 will be provided.
				</p>

				<h3 class="fs-5">Your Reimbursement</h3>
				
				<p>
					Your expense reimbursement will be sent within approximately four to six weeks upon receipt of your correctly completed expense statement(s) and if you have submitted the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>W&ndash;9 form</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Please note that a new W&ndash;9 form should be completed and returned for each test development conference that you attend. This policy is in place to ensure that there is no delay in processing your reimbursement check.
